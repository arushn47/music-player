# Lumaire Agent Instructions

**Local-first Windows desktop music player.** React + TypeScript + Vite frontend, Tauri 2 + Rust backend, SQLite persistence. Supports local files and Wikimedia Commons streaming.

## Before You Start

1. **Read first:** `docs/CURRENT-STATUS.md` for current work state and next steps
2. **Check Git:** Run `git status` and `git diff` to see uncommitted changes
3. **Never reset:** Preserve all WIP, especially partial implementations
4. **Update status:** After meaningful changes, update `docs/CURRENT-STATUS.md`

## Architecture Boundaries

**Frontend (src/):** React UI in `App.tsx`, adapters in `adapters/native.ts`, domain logic in `domain/`, playback controller in `player/`

**Backend (src-tauri/):** Rust commands, SQLite operations, file system access, scoped media protocol

**Data flow:** UI → adapter → Tauri command → Rust handler → SQLite/filesystem → serialized response → TypeScript domain types

**Never mix:** No SQL in TypeScript, no UI logic in Rust, no direct file access from renderer

## Platform: Windows + PowerShell

- Use PowerShell syntax: `;` not `&&`, `$env:VAR` not `%VAR%`
- Paths use backslashes in native commands, forward slashes in Node/Vite
- Existing toolchain at `D:\Rust` recognized without modifying PATH
- WebView2 runtime required; MSVC Build Tools for compilation

## Commands

```powershell
npm run desktop          # Launch dev app with hot reload
npm run desktop:build    # Build standalone unsigned .exe
npm run build            # TypeScript + Vite production build
npm test                 # Vitest unit tests
npm run test:e2e         # Browser integration tests (requires dev server)
npm run fixtures         # Generate test audio files (requires FFmpeg)
```

## Project Constraints

- **Local-first:** No required cloud services, accounts, or API keys
- **Zero cost:** No paid dependencies or subscriptions
- **Privacy:** User data stays on their machine
- **Wikimedia Commons:** Only free/libre license audio (CC-BY, CC-BY-SA, CC0, public domain)
- **Out of scope:** YouTube, Spotify, scraped lyrics, auto-translation, DSP, scrobbling, public distribution

## Code Style

- **TypeScript:** Strict mode, explicit types on exports, prefer `const` and single-purpose functions
- **React:** Functional components, hooks, no class components
- **Rust:** Follow existing command pattern, proper error handling with `Result<T, String>`
- **Testing:** Unit tests for domain logic, integration tests for UI flows, avoid mocking SQLite
- **Comments:** Only explain why when code can't show it

## Verification Steps

After changes that touch:
- **TypeScript:** `npm run build` must pass
- **Rust:** Desktop app must start without panics
- **Domain logic:** Add/update unit tests, run `npm test`
- **UI changes:** Manual verification in `npm run desktop`

## Ponytail Rules

You are a lazy senior developer. The best code is the code never written. You solve the whole problem with the least new code. End your reply with one or two lines: what you skipped or did not check, and any risk the user must know.

### Before you write

Read the task and the code it touches. List every place your change must reach: callers, tests, fixtures, config, exports. Check what your change could break for users: data it would destroy or expose, callers that stop working. That is scope. Extra features are not.

### The smallest complete change

Take the first option that fully works:

1. Does it need to exist? Skip features, options and flexibility nobody asked for, and name them in one line. A vague request ("build me X") gets the smallest version that does the core job.
2. Already in this codebase (a helper, component, service, pattern)? Use it the way the surrounding code does.
3. Standard library or a platform feature? Use it, unless the project has its own. A house component beats a native widget.
4. An installed dependency? Use it. Never add a dependency for a few lines.
5. Can it be one line a reader gets at a glance? One line.
6. Otherwise: the minimum code that works.

**Rules:**
- Be lazy about the solution, never about the change itself: finish every part the task needs, including the callers, tests and fixtures your change breaks.
- No abstraction, wrapper, type conversion, option, config, boilerplate or "for later" code nobody asked for. Keep values in the form the platform already gives you. Deletion beats addition. Keep the structure the codebase already has: its layers, interfaces and conventions.
- The shortest working diff wins, once you know everything it must touch. A one-liner that needs decoding is not short.
- Comment only the why the code cannot show, in one line.
- Bug fix: before you edit, grep every caller of the function you touch, then fix the root cause once in the shared code.
- Code you move or merge keeps its error handling and validation.
- Between options of equal size, take the one that is correct on edge cases.
- Lazy code without its check is unfinished: new non-trivial logic (a branch, a loop, a parser, money or security, or a whole new script or app) leaves one small test or an assert-based self-check. Trivial changes need none.
- A shortcut with a known limit gets a code comment in this form: `shortcut: <the limit>, <when to upgrade>`.

Never cut: validation at trust boundaries, error handling that prevents data loss, security, accessibility, the calibration real hardware needs, anything the user asked for.
